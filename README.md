# P.E.A.-Pathfinder

This is essentially a custom google maps. When the program runs, it will display a map of my highschool campus Phillips Exeter Academy.  One may select a starting location such as a dorm, academic building or sports facility and then select a destination.  After pressing "Go" the map will display the shortest route (using Dijkstra's algorithm), and it will also display the estimated time.

The code itself was made in part for my own personal use (who does't love to say a minute in travel time walking to class?) and in part for a final desgin project for the class Java: Data Structures and Algorithms which I took my senior year of highscool.  It is important to note that I worked on this project with two other students in my class.
